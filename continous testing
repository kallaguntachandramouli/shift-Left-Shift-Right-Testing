Continuous Testing is a software testing approach that involves testing throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC), from development to deployment.

Key Principles:
1.Test Early: test as early as possible in the SDLC.
2.Test Often: test continuously, with each new build or deployment.
3.Test Everywhere: test on all platforms, environments, and configurations.
4.Automate: automate testing wherever possible.
  
Continuous Testing Pipeline
1. Development: developers write code and commit changes
2. Continuous Integration: code is integrated and built
3. Automated Testing: automated tests are run, providing feedback to developers
4. Deployment: application is deployed to production
5. Monitoring: application is monitored, and feedback is collected

Tools and Technologies- CI/CD Tools: Jenkins. 
1.Testing Frameworks: JUnit, TestNG, PyUnit.
2. Automated Testing Tools: Selenium, Appium, Cucumber.
3. Monitoring Tools: New Relic, Datadog.
