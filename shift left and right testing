Shift Left Testing:
Shift Left Testing involves moving testing activities earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), closer to the development phase.
The Goals are:
    1. Catch defects earlier, reducing costs and improving quality
    2.Improve collaboration between developers and testers
    3. Reduce testing time and effort
The Activities of the left testing :
    1. Unit testing
    2. Integration testing
    3. Continuous Integration (CI)
    4. Automated testing

Shift Right Testing : 
Shift Right Testing involves moving testing activities later in the SDLC, closer to production.
The Goals:
    1. Validate the application's behavior in production-like environments
    2. Catch issues that arise from complex interactions and real-world usage
    3. Improve the overall quality and reliability of the application
The Activities of shift right testing :
    1. End-to-end testing
    2. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
    3. Performance testing
    4. Exploratory testing
    5. Monitoring and feedback
